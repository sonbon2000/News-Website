', '\r\n\r\nThe leak was posted on Raidforums, a forum where data leaks by hackers are often displayed and put up for sale, by an account named Ox1337xO on Thursday. The account allegedly revealed the possession of a large amount of Know Your Customer (KYC) data: 17 GB worth of Vietnamese identity card information, including faces, addresses, phone numbers and emails.\r\n\r\nA 1.4 GB file is estimated to contain the information of 3,600 people.\r\n\r\nThe account put the files on sale for $9,000, to be paid either through Bitcoin or Litecoin.\r\n\r\nA cybersecurity expert said they had contacted the account, who claimed the 17 GB worth of data contained the information of up to 10,000 Vietnamese.\r\n\r\nThe info contained within an identity card could be used to sign up for several accounts, including those in the communications and financial fields, which could prove \"troublesome,\" said Pham Tien Manh, a cybersecurity expert based in Hanoi.\r\n\r\nVo Do Thang, director of cybersecurity firm Athena, said there was nothing ordinary users could do to protect their data. The responsibility now lies on whoever let the data be leaked in the first place, he added.\r\n\r\nIn the comment section of Raidforums, the Ox1337xO account admitted to accessing the data via Pi Network, a digital currency platform that hosts the \"Pi\" currency. The platform has raised concerns regarding its transparency since it does not publicize its own source code.\r\n\r\n\"If it were truly Pi that leaked the data, I will consider leaving behind the \'Pi\' coins I\'ve earned,\" said Ngoc Nam, a new user to the \"Pi\" mining scene.\r\n\r\nHowever, other miners believe the leaked data could not have come from Pi Network, as the platform neither directly verifies its users\' info nor requests pictures of identity cards.\r\n\r\nPhien Vo, a moderator of a group discussing Pi Network, which has over 70,000 members in Vietnam, said it is not accurate to say it was Pi Network that leaked the data, as the platform processed KYC data through another third party system called Yoti, a digital identity verification site. Yoti accepts identity cards from 62 countries and territories, but the list does not include Vietnam, he added.\r\n\r\n\"To perform KYC verification on Pi Network, Vietnamese would need to use their passports. Only some users who used earlier versions of Pi could perform KYC verification using their driver licenses, but so far the system has yet to accept Vietnamese identity cards,\" he said.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the Ministry of Public Security\'s cybersecurity division launched an investigation regarding the incident. A representative said authorities are trying to discover where the leak came from and how the info got leaked.\r\n\r\nTo An Xo, office chief of the public security ministry, said the leaked data might be funneled abroad and put up for sale online due to the fact that many services require identity verification.\r\n\r\nAs of Sunday, the original data leak thread on Raidforums has been deleted.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time Vietnamese have experienced a major online data leak.

The first is FIFA could cancel all results of matches that involved North Korea, including five played and three unplayed games. This means the results against last-placed teams would also be canceled for other groups.\r\n\r\nIf that happens, in group G where Vietnam are playing, previous and upcoming matches of bottom team Indonesia would not be counted and the other teams in the group will be deducted six points. Vietnam would face huge pressure in the last two games with Malaysia and United Arab Amirates (UAE) in June.\r\n\r\nThe second senario is to set all North Korea\'s results in their remaining matches to 0-3 losses. This means the teams who have not played North Korea could benefit greatly since they would be handed a 3-0 win.\r\n\r\nThe four best runners-up of this qualification round would advance to the next stage, with the runner-up of group H benefits more than others.\r\n\r\nVietnam will only be affected by this disadvantage if they become the runner-up of group G.

During the Lunar New Year period, when the third Covid-19 wave broke out in the country, Quang Ha lost out on nearly 40 gigs.\r\n\r\nSinger My Tam postponed her \"Tri Am\" (Gratefulness) concert at Hanoi\'s My Dinh National Stadium that can hold up to tens of thousands of spectators, after tickets were sold out and stage assembly nearly complete.

The latest play, \"Roi Mac Gi Phai Cuoi\" (Then Why Are You Laughing), was performed four times before it was postponed, with Uyen failing to break even.\r\n\r\nAlthough the theater was closed at the beginning of the month, she still has to pay salaries to ticketing staff, backstage workers and others. She is currently renting an apartment since she had pledged her own house as bank collateral.\r\n\r\n\"In the past two years, I have spent billions of dong investing in plays but have yet to make a profit,\" she said.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, theater actress Hong Van described her current role as that of a \"boxer who gets knocked down several times a year.\" Acting in the play \"Nguoi Vo Ma\" (Ghost Wife) in early May, she was happy to see the theater filled to over-capacity. But the next day, both venues were closed down.\r\n\r\nAfter four Covid-19 waves, Van and many show organizers grew frustrated since the stage was only moderately active, with fewer and fewer audiences interested in attending theatrical performances.\r\n\r\n\"Audiences find online and television entertainment more convenient and safer during the pandemic.

(49, 'The dilemma of Vietnamese smartphone brands', 'The dependence on outsourced components and fierce competitions in the low-priced segment are the obstacles that hinder Vietnam’s smartphone manufacturers. ', '\r\n\r\nThe latest market exit of a Vietnamese smartphone brand is VinSmart, the smartphone manufacturing unit of Vietnam’s biggest private conglomerate Vingroup.\r\n\r\nThe company announced in a statement earlier this month that it will stop manufacturing smartphones as \"the production no longer brings breakthroughs and creates unique values for users.\"\r\n\r\nVinSmart was the fourth largest smartphone brand in Vietnam by market share in Q1.\r\n\r\nPrior to the exit of VinSmart, various Vietnamese mobile brands have vanished from the market, including Q-mobile and Mobiistar.\r\n\r\nA reason for the struggle of local mobile brands is that the Vietnamese manufacturers depend on imported phone components or even outsourcing the whole products, according to industry insiders.\r\n\r\nBack in 2010, Vietnamese smartphone brands mostly chose Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) as their business model, which means they select an already-existing product design from factories in other countries (mostly China), and sell it under their own brand name.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of ODM is that it helps companies to reduce costs, but at the same time, the companies do not own the technology, thus can not become the market leader.\r\n\r\nMai Trieu Nguyen, owner of smartphone retail chain Mai Nguyen, said that ODM is now inappropriate as \"when a company has to rely entirely on another manufacturer, it will not survive on the market.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smartphones that want to be sold well need to be different and creative. Therefore, smartphone brands that do not own the technology will fail,\" an expert working for a local smartphone brand said.\r\n\r\nIn VinSmart’s case, the company has its own factory, its research and development team with several notable technology achievements including under-display camera and quantum security chip. However, it still depends on imported phone components.\r\n\r\nThe global component market is being heavily hit by the pandemic, resulting in the global chip crisis. Components such as processing chips, display screen prices surge, while shipping time increases up to several months. Large phone manufacturers will buy out the phone components, with little units left for minor manufacturers to acquire.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the struggle of local phone brands is the fierce competition from the foreign opponents in the low-priced segment, which is the segment that most Vietnamese smartphone brands target.\r\n\r\nLow-priced segment is the market segment with smartphones priced under VND4 million ($174).\r\n\r\nAccording to data of two large smartphone retailers, Mobile World and FPT Shop, no VinSmart products are in the top seller lists in Q1. In a smaller retail chain, Hoang Ha Mobile, VinSmart phones that generated the most revenues in Q1 are the Vsmart Joy 4 and Vsmart Live 4, whose prices ranged from VND2.5-3.5 million. Meanwhile, only a few VinSmart products priced over VND5 million are sold.\r\n\r\nBphone, the smartphones developed by Vietnam’s cybersecurity firm BKAV, are priced over VND7 million and have never appeared in smartphone retail stores. Its sales are also undisclosed.\r\n\r\n\"The low-priced segment is dominated by Chinese brands, with large-scale production advantages and low prices, which the local brands are unable to compete with,\" the spokesperson of FPT Shop said.\r\n\r\nNguyen added that Vietnamese smartphones have to compete with the Korean smartphone giant Samsung with it’s A Series and M Series smartphones in the low-priced segment. At the same time, Chinese smartphone brands have been continuously releasing new models and lowering their prices in exchange for larger market share.\r\n\r\n\"Despite owning a decent market share, with 10 percent in Q1, VinSmart can hardly make profit from smartphone production as it has to invest heavily in factories and pay high salary for human resources,\" he said.\r\n\r\nTran Viet Hai, CEO of Bkav Electronics, the company that produces Bphone, said that price competition on the smartphone market is a \"cash burning game\" for producers, which leads to losses.\r\n\r\n\"When a smartphone brand only targets the low-priced segment, a minor increase in its selling price can lead to uncertainties among its customers. Therefore, solely targeting the low-priced segment is not a sustainable business strategy,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWithout VinSmart, some local mobile phone brands remaining are Bphone, VNPT Lotus of state-owned telecom firm VNPT, and Masstel of Vietnam’s smartphone producer Masscom Vietnam Corporation. Bphone now only has two smartphone models, Bphone B86 and Bphone B86s, while VNPT Lotus has virtually disappeared from the market and has not released any new phone model for many years.\r\n\r\nMasstel mostly produces phones that are thick in size and designed for the elderly, with the best selling model being the mobile phone priced at VND200,000.\r\n\r\nIndustry insiders said that there will hardly be another local smartphone brand that can replace VinSmart in the competition with the foreign brands.\r\n\r\nBKAV spokesperson said that the company will continue to develop smartphone technology.\r\n\r\n\"Vietnam\'s electronics industry is developing, and it certainly needs a leading local mobile phone brand,\" Hai said.\r\n', '2021-05-17', '6', 'Luu Quy', 3),

(61, 'Ant-Man 3 casting leak may reveal how the first X-Men joins the MCU', 'Are you ready to be dazzled?', 'Ant-Man 3 holds a special place in Marvel’s Phase Four slate. The blockbuster sequel is said to be the first MCU film that will feature Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror — a villain many believe will take over for Thanos as the MCU’s new big bad — and could lay some important groundwork for whatever is to come in Avengers 5.\r\n\r\nThe casting of Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang also implies that the film will see the character finally become a superhero like her father, which may in turn help set up Marvel’s rumored Young Avengers project. And now, an alleged casting leak from the film suggests that it could feature the MCU debut of yet another notable Marvel comics character.\r\n\r\nThe Theory — Murphy’s Multiverse reports that Marvel is currently in the process of casting another major role for Ant-Man 3 (officially titled Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), which is set to begin filming in the U.K. this coming July. According to the report, the studio is looking to hire a “young female of any ethnicity” between 9 and 12 years old to play an “unnamed lead character” in Quantumania.\r\n\r\nThe character will reportedly be 10 years old in the film, and the studio intends to cast an actress with “singing, dancing, and comedic chops.” The report goes on to note that it’s unlikely the character being cast is a younger version of Kathryn Newton’s Cassie Lang since Abby Ryder Fortson (who played Cassie in the first two Ant-Man movies) is still young enough to fill that role.\r\n\r\nSo who could the mystery character be?\r\n\r\nA Dazzling Possibility — Until Marvel formally reveals the entire cast of characters in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, it’s hard to know who this supposed mystery character is. That being said, the mention that the chosen actress must have singing, dancing, and comedic skills does hint at one iconic character from the Marvel comics who has yet to appear in the MCU.\r\n\r\nWe are, of course, talking about Dazzler.\r\n\r\nA fan-favorite comics character, Dazzler is a professional singer with the power to manipulate sound into light. She’s capable of creating light shows, holograms, blinding people, and can even shoot bursts of light out of her body. She’s basically what it would look like if a pop star was an actual superhero.\r\n\r\nShe’s also a mutant in the comics, which is why she hasn’t appeared in the MCU up to this point. Now that Marvel has the ability to use mutants in its films now though, it’s entirely possible that it’ll start planting certain mutant characters in their upcoming projects and Dazzler makes sense for the Ant-Man franchise’s lighter comedic tone.\r\n\r\nThe character’s minuscule movie history (she only made a brief appearance in X-Men: Dark Phoenix) means the studio doesn’t need to worry about viewers getting used to a new actress in the role either.\r\n\r\nThe Inverse Analysis — Assuming that this report is correct and there really is a mystery role being cast right now for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, there are a few possibilities of who the character could be.\r\n\r\nThey could end up being a younger version of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope Van Dyne or Michelle Pfeiffer’s Janet, or an entirely new superpowered character. Of those possibilities, Dazzler is still the most exciting, and one of the only characters an actress would logically need dancing and singing skills to play.\r\n\r\nSo who knows? Maybe Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania will give the MCU its first-ever superpowered pop star? And if Marvel was to keep her origin story from the comics, then she’d also be the MCU’s first mutant. Talk about taking out two birds with one stone.\r\n\r\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania will be released in theaters on February 17, 2023.', '2021-05-15', '14', 'Alex Welch', 1),

In 1900, the tramcar ran the first four kilometers from Bo Ho to Thuy Khue. By 1930, the company had six tramcar lines with a total length of 26 kilometers.\r\n\r\nFrom 1954 to 1990, there were no spare parts, which threatened safety, so the tram was removed. The company incurred losses because of large initial investments and low ticket prices. It had bought land at low prices from the city, and had made a profit by selling the land later, when the prices soared after the tram opened.

While the No1 line coincided with the Yen Vien – Ngoc Hoi railway (34.5 kilometer) and the No 4 line in the outer area (52.5 kilometer), the other 100 kilometers would coincide with the six old tramcar lines.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that in the central area of the city, there was no room for TDR. Land outside the city was allocated to investors for real estate development, so there was no more land for conversion.\r\n\r\nTen years later, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) submitted a transport development plan for Hanoi with 8 urban railway lines at a total length of 460 kilometers.

What’s so special about this dish? Let’s find out!\r\n\r\nBun Cha (grilled pork with rice noodles) is an exquisite dish that’s intricately linked to Hanoi, where it originated. There are three components to this dish: a bowl of grilled thinly sliced pork belly and/or minced pork patties served in light dipping sauce with pickled veggies, a plate of rice noodles, along with a basket of fresh herbs such as perilla leaves, coriander, and lettuce.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of bun cha across Vietnam, but the Hanoi version is still held in high esteem. And although not much is known about how and when it was invented, bun cha has been referred to multiple times in literature.\r\n\r\nIn Hanoi: 36 Pho Phuong (Hanoi: 36 Streets and Guilds), a book that showcases the variety of Hanoi cuisine, writer Thach Lam acclaims: “It’s just the same kind of Bun Cha, with the same kinds of vegetables and rice noodles. So why is Hanoi’s Bun Cha so scrumptious and delicious, from the fragrance to the sauce.”\r\n\r\nThe essence of Hanoi’s cuisine relies on delicacy and elegance. Compared to other regions like Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), where tend to use a lot of strong and sweet flavors, foods in Hanoi are simpler, more rustic, but are imbued with sophistication.\r\n\r\nOf course, Bun Cha is not an exception. The sliced pork and pork patties are well-marinated with a variety of spices such as fish sauce, liquid caramel and garlic. The longer the marinating period, the more pronounced the flavor becomes. Afterward, the meat is grilled over hot charcoal until it turns into a gorgeous golden-brown color.\r\n\r\nThe dipping sauce is also a part making the dish quintessential. It consists of fish sauce, sugar, water and vinegar are combined in a golden ratio. The overall flavor should strike a balance between sweet, sour, and savory. Most stores add chopped garlic to make the sauce even bolder and more pungent. If you’re a fan of spices, don’t hesitate to sprinkle on top some black pepper and slide in a few thin slices of chilies. In the dipping sauce, you’ll also find pickled carrots and green papaya, which add such a flair to the food.\r\n\r\nAnd you cannot forget the component that almost all noodle dishes in Vietnam have – a basket filled with all the fresh herb goodness. There is lettuce, mint, coriander, perilla, and basil, all of which chase away the fattinessof the meat and give a fresh dimension to the meal. So, grab a piece of meat, dip it into the sauce along with some noodles and herbs, and indulge in a stunning harmony of savory, sour, spicy, and sweet flavors.\r\nBun Cha can be easily found anywhere, from luxurious restaurants to street-side eateries. But one of my favorite spots is a store located in the bustling street Hang Giay. When passing by the store, you’ll be surrounded with the intriguing aroma of grilled pork that’s hard to pass up. It’s actually quite spacious, so there shouldn’t be any problem with seating. If you like, you can choose to sit at the table set up outside of the store and watch the world go by.In the morning, this store sells pho. But during lunch time, Bun Cha is served. The pork belly slices here are neither too fatty nor too gamy. In fact, they’re soft and very well-seasoned. The minced pork patties are quite special as well; they are wrapped inside perilla leaves of which pungent taste pairs awfully well with grilled meat.\r\n\r\nThe dipping sauce has a well-balanced flavor, too. The garlic and chilies aren’t put directly into the sauce, so feel free to season to your taste. The herbs are fresh as well!  \r\n\r\nIf you have a chance to visit Hanoi and want to taste something that showcases the best of Hanoi cuisine, give Bun Cha a try.', '2021-05-13', '22', 'Hanoitimes', 4),
